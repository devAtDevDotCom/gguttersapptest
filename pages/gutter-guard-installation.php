                    <h4>Gutter Guard FAQ</h4>
                    <p class="bold-text">Q: Do Gutter Guards Really Work?</p>
                    <p>A: Absolutely! Although, experts tend to agree that gutter guards don’t provide foolproof protection, they certainly help in increasing the water flow rate and making your gutters manageable, expecially during medium to heavy downpours.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="bold-text" >Q: Do you need to clean gutters with Gutter Guards and if so, How often?</p>
                    <p>A: While the gutter guards do prevent leaves, branches and other debris from building up, some debris may build up on top of the guard. There are smaller particles, that can sneak through the guard. For this reason, you’ll need to clean the top of your gutter guards throughout the year to make sure water still drains through to your gutters, you should plan on cleaning off your gutter
                    guards and have the downspouts checked at least every two years; more or less often in some cases, depending if your home has valleys or heavy tree coverage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="bold-text">Q: Do Gutter Guards add value to your home?</p>
                    <p>A: Yes! When quality gutter guards are professionally installed, they can increase a home’s overall value.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="bold-text">Q: Do Gutter Guards promote ice Dams?</p>
                    <p>A: In some cases, Gutter Guards may contribute to ice build up. A strong maintenance plan helps to increase water flow rate and make your gutters manageable all year round.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="bold-text">Q: What are the Top 5 reasons for ice build up?</p>
                    <p>1. Hot Attic: This is the most common way ice dams form. It happens when your home is simply not 
                     <p>2.  Clogged Gutters and Downspouts: Gutters that are clogged with leaves and debris are likely to cause water to sit in your gutters instead of draining out as it should. This stagnant water freezes, contributing to the formation of ice dams.</p>
                     
                     <p>3. Fluctuating Temperatures: Some causes of ice dams are out of your hands.</p>
                    
                     <p>4. Radiant Heat from the Sun Temperatures:  Temperatures can hold below freezing during the day and during the night, but ice dams can continue to form if the <a href="https://icedamremovalguys.com/learning-center/how-the-weather-can-undermine-your-ice-dam-prevention/"> radiant heat from the sun</a> manages to melt the snow on your roof, despite the ambient temperature being below freezing.</p>

                     <p>5. <a href="https://icedamremovalguys.com/learning-center/how-the-weather-can-undermine-your-ice-dam-prevention/"> Perfect Temperatures: </a>Be wary of ice dams when temperatures sit between 30 and 32 degrees – right at freezing, or just under freezing.</p>
